# AutoSitecore Customizations

This repo contains a list of [AutoFixture customizations](https://autofixture.github.io/docs/fixture-customization/#) intended to simplify unit testing in Sitecore projects. It's not a library or framework like FakeDb. It's rather a collection of primitive helpers that can be copied into existing codebases and adjusted as needed.
